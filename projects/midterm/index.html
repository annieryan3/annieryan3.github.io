            <p>Who are you having dinner with tonight? Perhaps you mustered the courage to ask your crush on a date? Or
                maybe your meal is more family stock-photo-esque, complete with smiling children eating all of their
                veggies without question. Or are you having dinner by yourself? Before you go off tweeting about being
                #ForeverAlone, you should know that eating alone is becoming more and more common.</p>
            <p>In 2003, the tens of thousands of people who took part in the American Time Use Survey — a representative
                sample of Americans aged 15 to 85 — reported that they ate 32% of their meals alone. As the
                survey-takers continued collecting data over the years, that number rose to 35% in 2015.</p>
            <p>A three percent increase doesn’t sound like that much. But it does translate to the average American
                eating alone one extra day per month. And, as you might guess, that extra day is not distributed evenly
                throughout the population.</p>
            <p>Generally speaking, as we get older, we eat alone more and more frequently. But there are a few
                interesting things worth noting here.</p>
        </div>

        <section class="section graphics" style="padding: 40px 0;">
            <div class="container">

                <h3 class="mb-4 text-center" style="font-size: 28px;">Frequency of dining alone by age</h3>

                <div class="row align-items-center mb-5">

                    <div class="col-md-6" style="font-size: 18px;">
                        <p>First, look at this dip for people in their 30’s. These folks were eating noticeably fewer
                            meals alone per
                            month than people just a decade younger than them.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="row align-items-center mb-5">
                    <div class="col-md-6 mb-3">
                        <img src="img/chart-dining-2.png" alt="chart" class="img-fluid w-100">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6" style="font-size: 18px;">
                        <p>I also noticed that once people hit 70 years old, they experienced a steep upward trend in
                            solitary eating.
                            Though these data are from 2003, a lot changed in the 12 years between that survey and the
                            most recent one
                            from 2015.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="row align-items-center mb-5">
                    <div class="col-md-6 mb-3">

                    <div class="col-md-6" style="font-size: 18px;">
                        <p>Once I added the data from 2015, the patterns really caught my attention. It looks like
                            millennials and baby
                            boomers finally have something in common — both groups have begun eating alone more
                            frequently than people
                            their age did back in 2003. Meanwhile, the dining habits of the other age groups remained
                            relatively
                            unchanged.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="row align-items-center mb-5">
                    <div class="col-md-6 mb-3">
                        <img src="img/chart-dining-4.png" alt="chart" class="img-fluid w-100">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6" style="font-size: 18px;">
                        <p>I decided to slice the population into five age groups: 15–19, 20–30, 30–50, 50–75, and
                            75–85. These
                            correspond to roughly alternating groups of no-change/change in dining habits. These curves
                            seem to follow
                            the archetypal family life: living with parents, moving out, starting a family, empty nests,
                            and growing old
                            together. I wanted to see if there was more to this hypothesis.</p>

            <p> To figure it out, I added data that reports with whom people share their meals. I hoped that this would
                help me figure out if the patterns observed from lone-diners do, in fact, match up with this
                quintessential American lifestyle. Below, you’ll see the change in dining companions for each age group
                from 2003 to 2015.

            <p>As expected, teens share most of their meals with parents, siblings, and friends. In fact, the number of
                family meals experienced by the youngest survey-takers is on the rise. This trend is echoed by a similar
                rise in people around their parents’ age (31-50 year olds) sharing meals with their children. It’s
                possible
                that these bonus home-cooked meals are a result of children “leaving the nest”

                    class="text-orange-500 hover:underline">later than they used to</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Looking at the twenty-somethings and 50-75 year olds, I saw that both groups did eat alone more
                frequently
                than in 2003, but possibly for different reasons. The twenty-somethings dined less frequently with their
                spouses or children and more frequently with their unmarried partners. This is likely a reflection of
                the
                changes in family-timing in America. Today’s young people are
                <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/estimated-median-age-marriage-2303878"
                    class="text-orange-500 hover:underline">getting married</a>, and
                <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/science/age-when-american-women-have-children.html"
                    class="text-orange-500 hover:underline">having children</a>
                later than their predecessors. They’re also more likely to
                <a
                    href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/06/number-of-u-s-adults-cohabiting-with-a-partner-continues-to-rise-especially-among-those-50-and-older/">move
                    in with their partner</a> before marriage.
            </p>

            <p>The 51-75 year olds appear to be having a different type of relationship-change, at least according to
                their
                dining habits. The decrease in dining with a spouse almost exactly mirrors the increase in meals spent
                alone. While we can’t know for sure, it’s possible that this is a reflection of people that
                <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/183515/fewer-young-people-say-relationship.aspx">remain
                    unmarried</a>.
                Divorce is another possible explanation, though, by all accounts, divorce rates are at a
                <a href="http://time.com/4575495/divorce-rate-nearly-40-year-low/">near 40-year low</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Depending on your view of the world, these changes can be welcome or scary. In my book: as long as you’re
                happy with how things turned out, congratulations to you. It is, though, a matter of fact that Americans
                are
                not only more alone, but
                <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinebeaton/2017/02/09/why-millennials-are-lonely/">also feel
                    lonelier</a>.
                The feeling of social isolation against how one would like to have is both hard and a health problem,
                <a
                    href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/01/18/loneliness-might-be-a-bigger-health-risk-than-smoking-or-obesity">possibly
                    on par with smoking and obesity</a>.
                Having a partner to share your life is of course not the only way to have company, but it is the most
                common one.
            </p>

            <p>An optimist by nature, I couldn’t help but look for a silver lining in the data. It took a while, but I
                eventually found it. People aged 75 to 85 didn’t eat alone more often now than they did in the past.
                Despite
                more of them being divorced or staying single altogether, this age group dines with their spouse 5%
                <strong>more</strong> now than before. In the 12 years between these surveys, the average American’s
                life
                expectancy has risen by two years. Those years are the reason. They give us more time to spend with our
                significant others. And that, for those who chose it, is a very good reason to smile.

        <p>Methodology: All of the data used in this essay came from the American Time Use Survey in which thousands of
            Americans report what activities they did during a day in their life. For practical reasons, people can only
            report doing one thing at a time. A “meal” is considered a chunk of time when the person reported 110101 -
            Eating and drinking. If a person was multi-tasking,(e.g. grabbing a sandwich while walking to work), their
            activity may not be considered a meal. In the aforementioned example, that activity might be reported as
            180501 - Travel related to working and would not be included in this analysis. On average, people reported
            Eating and drinking about twice a day. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes all data on their website.
